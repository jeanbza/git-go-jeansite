    This post will talk briefly about the basic Godoc functionality - if you have already been exposed to godoc, you probably know all of this. Fair warning! For those of you who haven't taken a look at godoc, check out <a href="http://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code">this summary of godoc</a> and <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary">quickly read through Go's recommended Commentary section</a>. What follows is a couple of examples of godoc.

    <h4>Host the entire golang docs...on your machine!</h4>
    Yep! ALL of the google docs live on your machine. Navigate to the go common code (run 'which go' to see where it lives). Type godoc -http=:6060 and (in your browser) go to http://localhost:6060. You can also add -index=true if you'd like searchable docs, as per the officially hosted docs.

    <h4>Use godoc to generate documentation for your code</h4>
    Just type godoc -http=:6060 -goroot="/path/to/your/project". Simple as that!

    <h4>Use godoc to search for packages in the command line</h4>
    If I'm looking for the regexp package, I can simply type godoc regexp to get the regexp documentation. If I'm looking for something like 'parse', I can narrow down my search even further with something like godoc regexp | grep parse. Sweet!
